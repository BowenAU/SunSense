          Sunshine is great for life, but it can also be bad for your health In Australia, many
          people get skin cancer, especially a type called melanoma, and this is a big health
          problem for young people. We can use science to reduce the risk of skin cancer while
          enjoying being outside. This is good for our own health and for protecting a better life.
          Let us enjoy the sunshine, but also know how to protect ourselves!

          <h2>Understanding the Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            Now we focus on challenges. Such as misinformation, tanning trends in social media, lack
            of awareness, vitamin D deficiencies and so on.

          <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
          <p>
            Why do we need a website for UV protection? First I will talk about the background in
            detail. According to the report, Australia has one of the highest melanoma rates
            globally, yet unsafe tanning trends persist. People with darker skin also face Vitamin D
            deficiencies due to lower sun absorption. In addition, there are many young people who
            have migrated to Australia from other countries who lack basic knowledge of UV
            protection. And the website provides science-backed guidance on these relevant
            knowledge.
